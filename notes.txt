the initialised data that is int a=10  is stored in data segment whereas only if uninitialised data that is int a is written its atored in bss segment 
using of heap is dynamic 
functions for dynamic memory allocation are calloc, malloc, realloc, free
in malloc all the values are initialosed with garbage value whereas in calloc they are initialised with 0
malloc synatx: int *ptr
               ptr=(ptr_type*)malloc(no of blocks*size());
calloc syntax: int *ptr
               ptr=(ptr_type*)calloc(n,size());
realloc is used to resize the old pointer 
ptr=(ptr_type*)realloc(ptr,new_size_in_bytes);
free is used to free the allocated memory
free(ptr);

for using dynamic allocation include stlib.h

typedef is used to give a new name 
syntax: typedef<old_name> <alias_name>
generally usedwhen the oldname is very odd or long

the major difference between structure and union is that in structure each memeber has been alloted with separate memory whereas in union all members have shared memory allocation which is equal to the greatest one 

adt is abstarct data type whch tells about some features and operation that are performed in that data type
it provides a model for its usage
